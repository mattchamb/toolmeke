## What is ToolMeke?

ToolMeke is a **completely independent** tool price comparison website created as a personal side project. Our mission is simple: help New Zealand DIY enthusiasts and tradies find better deals on tools by comparing prices across major hardware stores.

## Why We Built This

As tool enthusiasts ourselves, we were frustrated by having to visit multiple store websites to compare prices for the same tools. We created ToolMeke to solve this problem - bringing all the price data together in one place for easy comparison.

## What Makes Us Different

### ðŸš« No Affiliations
- We have **zero affiliations** with any hardware stores or manufacturers
- We're not sponsored, endorsed, or connected to any retailers
- We maintain complete independence in our price comparisons

### ðŸ’° No Commissions
- We **don't earn money** from your purchases
- No affiliate links, no commission fees, no kickbacks
- This project is funded entirely out of our own pocket

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: We automatically gather pricing data from various New Zealand hardware store websites
2. **Price Comparison**: Our system compares prices for identical or equivalent tools across different retailers
3. **Regular Updates**: Prices are updated regularly to ensure accuracy (though we recommend double-checking current prices before purchasing)

## Important Notes

- **Always verify prices**: While we strive for accuracy, prices can change quickly. Always check the retailer's website for current pricing
- **No guarantees**: We don't guarantee price accuracy or availability
- **For comparison only**: Our data is intended for comparison purposes to help guide your purchasing decisions
