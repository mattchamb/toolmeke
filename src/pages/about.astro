      <h1 class="f1 fw6 mb4 dark-gray">About ToolMeke</h1>
      
      <h2 class="f2 fw6 mb3 dark-gray">What is ToolMeke?</h2>
      <p class="mb4">
        ToolMeke is a <strong>completely independent</strong> tool price comparison website created as a personal side project. 
        Our mission is simple: help New Zealand DIY enthusiasts and tradies find better deals on tools by comparing prices across major hardware stores.
      </p>

      <h2 class="f2 fw6 mb3 dark-gray">Why We Built This</h2>
      <p class="mb4">
        As tool enthusiasts ourselves, we were frustrated by having to visit multiple store websites to compare prices for the same tools. 
        We created ToolMeke to solve this problem - bringing all the price data together in one place for easy comparison.
      </p>

      <h2 class="f2 fw6 mb3 dark-gray">What Makes Us Different</h2>
      
      <h3 class="f3 fw6 mb2 dark-gray">ðŸš« No Affiliations</h3>
      <ul class="mb4">
        <li>We have <strong>zero affiliations</strong> with any hardware stores or manufacturers</li>
        <li>We're not sponsored, endorsed, or connected to any retailers</li>
        <li>We maintain complete independence in our price comparisons</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="f3 fw6 mb2 dark-gray">ðŸ’° No Commissions</h3>
      <ul class="mb4">

        <li>No affiliate links, no commission fees, no kickbacks</li>
        <li>This project is funded entirely out of our own pocket</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="f2 fw6 mb3 dark-gray">How It Works</h2>
      <ol class="mb4">
        <li class="mb2"><strong>Data Collection</strong>: We automatically gather pricing data from various New Zealand hardware store websites</li>
        <li class="mb2"><strong>Price Comparison</strong>: Our system compares prices for identical or equivalent tools across different retailers</li>
        <li class="mb2"><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Prices are updated regularly to ensure accuracy (though we recommend double-checking current prices before purchasing)</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="f2 fw6 mb3 dark-gray">Important Notes</h2>
      <ul class="mb4">
        <li class="mb2"><strong>Always verify prices</strong>: While we strive for accuracy, prices can change quickly. Always check the retailer's website for current pricing</li>
        <li class="mb2"><strong>No guarantees</strong>: We don't guarantee price accuracy or availability</li>
        <li class="mb2"><strong>For comparison only</strong>: Our data is intended for comparison purposes to help guide your purchasing decisions</li>
      </ul>
