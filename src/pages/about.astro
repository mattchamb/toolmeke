        <h2 class="title is-2 has-text-dark">What is ToolMeke?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          ToolMeke is a <strong>completely independent</strong> tool price comparison website created as a personal side project. 
          Our mission is simple: help New Zealand DIY enthusiasts and tradies find better deals on tools by comparing prices across major hardware stores.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-2 has-text-dark">Why We Built This</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          As tool enthusiasts ourselves, we were frustrated by having to visit multiple store websites to compare prices for the same tools. 
          We created ToolMeke to solve this problem - bringing all the price data together in one place for easy comparison.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title is-2 has-text-dark">What Makes Us Different</h2>
        
        <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-dark">ðŸš« No Affiliations</h3>
        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>We have <strong>zero affiliations</strong> with any hardware stores or manufacturers</li>
          <li>We're not sponsored, endorsed, or connected to any retailers</li>
          <li>We maintain complete independence in our price comparisons</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="title is-4 has-text-dark">ðŸ’° No Commissions</h3>
        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>We <strong>don't earn money</strong> from your purchases</li>
          <li>No affiliate links, no commission fees, no kickbacks</li>
          <li>This project is funded entirely out of our own pocket</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title is-2 has-text-dark">How It Works</h2>
        <ol class="mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Data Collection</strong>: We automatically gather pricing data from various New Zealand hardware store websites</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Price Comparison</strong>: Our system compares prices for identical or equivalent tools across different retailers</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Regular Updates</strong>: Prices are updated regularly to ensure accuracy (though we recommend double-checking current prices before purchasing)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="title is-2 has-text-dark">Important Notes</h2>
        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>Always verify prices</strong>: While we strive for accuracy, prices can change quickly. Always check the retailer's website for current pricing</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>No guarantees</strong>: We don't guarantee price accuracy or availability</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><strong>For comparison only</strong>: Our data is intended for comparison purposes to help guide your purchasing decisions</li>
        </ul>
